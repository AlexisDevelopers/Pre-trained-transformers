This project uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement a pretrained T5 model capable of performing English to French translation tasks, completing sentences, and summarizing text.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and pre-installing Transformers and Sentencepiece. An English input string is defined below to be used as an example.

Then, a T5 tokenizer is created from the pretrained weights of "t5-base" and a pretrained T5ForConditionalGeneration model is also loaded from "t5-base".

The input string is tokenized with the T5 tokenizer and the French translated output is generated with the T5 model. Finally, the output is decoded using the T5 tokenizer and the result is printed.

Next, a sentence completion task is performed, where an incomplete sentence is provided and the model must predict the missing words. An input string is defined and tokenized using the T5 tokenizer. A tag string is then defined to tell the model which words are missing and are tokenized in the same way. Finally, the T5 model is used to predict the missing words in the sentence using the input and the label and the loss and logit outputs are stored.

Finally, a text summary task is performed, where a text is provided and the model must generate a brief summary of it. An input string is defined and tokenized using the T5 tokenizer. The T5 model is then used to generate a digest of the text and the output is decoded using the T5 tokenizer and the result is printed.

Overall, this project demonstrates how a pre-trained Transformers T5 model can be used to perform natural language tasks such as translation, sentence completion, and text summaries easily and effectively.
